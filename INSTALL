Couldn't be easier:

make
make install

By default, it'll put the executable ("beep") in /usr/bin.  If you don't like 
this, change the makefile as appropriate.

This will get things off and running, but you'll probably want to check the man
page section "IOCTL_WACKINESS" to see if you will need to fix any permissions.
